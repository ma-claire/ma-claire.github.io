Hi there ‚úåÔ∏è nice to meet you! I‚Äôm a developer and data enthusiast based in Toronto, Ontario.

I‚Äôm passionate about building efficient, data-driven solutions and creating user-friendly digital experiences. With a background spanning financial analysis, data science, and systems implementation, I‚Äôve worked with tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, TypeScript, React, and SAP to optimize operations, improve reporting accuracy, and support strategic decision-making. My experience bridges both the technical and business worlds, allowing me to approach problems with a holistic, audience-focused mindset.

In my free time, I love to play at and visit card shops, explore neighbourhoods through food, and occasionally bring out my inner chef. Also, did someone say bubble tea? üßã
